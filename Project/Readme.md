# 🧠 Full Stack Web Development Projects (MERN + Core Topics)

Welcome to my project repository! This repo includes **mini projects** organized by frontend/backend topics and **major projects** focused on individual MERN stack technologies like JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## 📁 Project Structure  

### 🚀 Major Projects (By MERN Stack Component)
Each major project covers deep understanding of a single stack component.

| Tech        | Description                                | Link (if available)     |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| 💻 JavaScript | Real-world apps using JS, DOM, ES6+         | `projects/js/`           |
| ⚛️ React      | Components, Hooks, Router-based projects     | `projects/react/`        |
| 🔧 Node.js    | Core backend logic, file systems, modules    | `projects/node/`         |
| 🌐 Express.js | REST APIs, middleware, routing logic         | `projects/express/`      |
| 🗂️ MongoDB     | CRUD operations, aggregation pipelines       | `projects/mongodb/`      |

### 🧩 Mini Projects (Topic-Wise Practice)
These are small apps or exercises created while learning specific topics.

| Category          | Description                                 | Folder             |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| 💡 JavaScript Basics | Arrays, Objects, HOFs, DOM                | `mini-projects/js/`  |
| 🎨 CSS + HTML UI     | Responsive layouts, CSS animations        | `mini-projects/ui/`  |
| 📟 React Components  | Reusable buttons, forms, input handling   | `mini-projects/react/` |
| 🔗 API Integration   | Fetching & rendering APIs (weather, news) | `mini-projects/apis/`  |
| 🧪 Testing & Debug   | Console practice, JS logic games          | `mini-projects/test/`  |
